# Argopy Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Which versions of **argopy** are currently being supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| master branch  | :white_check_mark: |
| others  | :x:                |

In other words, **argopy** releases that can be installed through the pypi and conda distribution channels are NOT updated with regard to security issues.

Once a security issue has been reported (see below) and addressed in a specific PR, only an **argopy** installation from the master branch will benefit from it.

Depending on the severity of the security vulnerability, a new release may be published.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you need to report a vulnerability, please login with your Github account and fill in a draft security advisory here:
https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy/security/advisories/new

The **argopy** team should get back to you in a timely manner depending on the severity of the reported vulnerability.
