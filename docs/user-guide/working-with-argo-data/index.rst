Working with Argo data
======================

**argopy** not only get you easy access to Argo data, it also aims to help you work with it.

In the following documentation sections, you will see how to:

- :ref:`manipulate <Manipulating data>` a :class:`xarray.Dataset` with the ``argo`` accessor methods,
- :ref:`visualize <data-viz>` Argo data, weather it is a :class:`xarray.Dataset` or :class:`pandas.DataFrame` profile index,
- use **argopy** helper methods for :ref:`Argo quality control <data_qc>`.
