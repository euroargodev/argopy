DT Report
AB Every Argo data file submitted by a DAC for distribution on the GDAC has its format and data consistency checked by the Argo FileChecker. Two types of checks are applied: 1. Format checks. Ensures the file formats match the Argo standards precisely. 2. Data consistency checks. Additional data consistency checks are performed on a file after it passes the format checks. These checks do not duplicate any of the quality control checks performed elsewhere. These checks can be thought of as “sanity checks” to ensure that the data are consistent with each other. The data consistency checks enforce data standards and ensure that certain data values are reasonable and/or consistent with other information in the files. Examples of the “data standard” checks are the “mandatory parameters” defined for meta-data files and the technical parameter names in technical data files. Files with format or consistency errors are rejected by the GDAC and are not distributed. Less serious problems will generate warnings and the file will still be distributed on the GDAC. Reference Tables and Data Standards: Many of the consistency checks involve comparing the data to the published reference tables and data standards. These tables are documented in the User’s Manual. (The FileChecker implements “text versions” of these tables.)
