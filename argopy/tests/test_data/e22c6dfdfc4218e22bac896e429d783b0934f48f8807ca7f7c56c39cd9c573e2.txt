DT Report
AB This document does NOT address the issue of particle backscattering quality control (either real-time or delayed mode). As a preliminary step towards that goal, this document seeks to ensure that all countries deploying floats equipped with backscattering sensors document the data and metadata related to these floats properly. We produced this document in response to action item 9 from the first Bio-Argo Data Management meeting in Hyderabad (November 12-13, 2012). If the recommendations contained herein are followed, we will end up with a more uniform set of particle backscattering data within the Bio-Argo data system, allowing users to begin analyzing not only their own particle backscattering data, but also those of others, in the true spirit of Argo data sharing.
