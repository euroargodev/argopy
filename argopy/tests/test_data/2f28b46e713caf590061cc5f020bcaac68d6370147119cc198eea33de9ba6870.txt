DT Report
AB This DAC cookbook is to include instructions for the DACs on how to calculate different variables for the Argo profile files. This is especially true for some of the additional sensors that are being added to Argo floats. The extra variables increase the complexity of the profile file and extra instructions may be necessary, depending on float and sensor type. It is separate from other data manuals because users do not need to understand all these details, but that it is important that all DACs to be calculating the variables in the same manner. There are instructions in this cookbook that apply to all floats and some that apply to only certain float types. Look through the table of contents for the specific float types included.
