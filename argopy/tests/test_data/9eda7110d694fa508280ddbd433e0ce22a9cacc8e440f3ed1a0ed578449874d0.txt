DT Report
AB This document is the Argo quality control manual for Dissolved oxygen concentration. It describes two levels of quality control: 	- The first level is the real-time system that performs a set of agreed automatic checks. Adjustment in real-time can also be performed and the real-time system can evaluate quality flags for adjusted fields. 	- The second level is the delayed-mode quality control system.
