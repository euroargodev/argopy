      "@value": "Near-surface sampling scheme for which the 'discrete' sampling method was used, and measurements obtained from an unpumped CTD stream. The near-surface sampling profile has N_PROF>1. It is composed of measurements focusing on the top 5 dbar of the water column, which may extend deeper so as to overlap with the primary sampling profile for the purpose of cross-calibration. These measurements are taken at pressure levels different from the primary sampling profile, or obtained by a sampling method different from that of the primary sampling profile. The 'discrete' sampling method refers to profiles where each data point was obtained from a single measurement (polling) from a sensor. Primary sampling profiles measuring above 5 dbar should not be labelled with this sampling scheme."
