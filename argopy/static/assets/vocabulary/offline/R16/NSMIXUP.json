      "@value": "Near-surface sampling scheme for which the 'mixed' sampling method was used, and measurements obtained from an unpumped CTD stream. The near-surface sampling profile has N_PROF>1. It is composed of measurements focusing on the top 5 dbar of the water column, which may extend deeper so as to overlap with the primary sampling profile for the purpose of cross-calibration. These measurements are taken at pressure levels different from the primary sampling profile, or obtained by a sampling method different from that of the primary sampling profile. The 'mixed' sampling method refers to profiles composed of data points obtained by both the 'averaged' and 'discrete' sampling methods. Primary sampling profiles measuring above 5 dbar should not be labelled with this sampling scheme."
